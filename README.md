# Rubiks-Cube
An algorithm that will generate a Rubik's Cube and solve it.

The RubiksCube class is a model of a real Rubiks Cube. When the class is instantiated, the cube is empty. By running `initialize_cube()` the cube faces will get randomly initialized with colors. 

After it's been initialized, you can run `solve_cube()` and the cube will solve itself.
